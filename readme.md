# Home-Assistant Config by [@mixpix405](http://www.twitter.com/mixpix405)
[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration files (and some referenced files)

This is the initial commit. Everything is pretty poorly organized, but it works. I'll be getting it all organized better as I go along.

**Devices I'm using:**
* **Google WiFi** : My router. I like it. It works.
* **RaspberryPi 3**
* **Aeotec Z-Stick (Gen 5)** : To controll z-wave devices!
* **Z-wave devices** : 4 GE z-wave in-wall switches
* **SmartThings Hub** : I currently have this talking to HA via MQTT. I've mostly migrated from ST to HA (all z-wave devices are controlled by HA, as are all automations), but I had a few zigbee devices that I'm still controlling / monitoring this way.
* **Zigbee Devices** : 
    * **PEQ Door Sensor** : This was cheap and works great. Reports open/close, as well as temperature. Unfortunately, I can't get their online store to load any longer, so... I can't buy any more.
    * **PEQ Motion Sensor** : Same as above, except detects motion (obviously) and temp.
    * **PEQ Dimmable Outlet** : Using this for a bedside lamp.
* **Google Home + Google Home Mini** : These are great for all sorts of stuff, including TTS to scream at the family in the morning letting them know that they'll inevitably be late for school/work.
* **Nest Thermostat**
